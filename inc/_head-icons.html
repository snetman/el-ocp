<link rel="shortcut icon" href="_/img/favicon.ico" />
<!-- This is the traditional favicon.
	 - size: 16x16 or 32x32

<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="_/img/apple-touch-icon.png" />
<!-- The is the icon for iOS's Web Clip.
	 - size: 57x57 for older iPhones, 72x72 for iPads, 114x114 for iPhone4's retina display (IMHO, just go ahead and use the biggest one)
	 - To prevent iOS from applying its styles to the icon name it thusly: apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
	 - Transparency is not recommended (iOS will put a black BG behind the icon) -->
